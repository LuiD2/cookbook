notes: []
ingredients:
 - [225, g, white beans, cannelinni or great northern]
 - [1, T, dried sage leaves]
 - [6, clove, garlic]
 - [1, t, salt]
 - [300, g, onion (yellow), chopped]
 - [1, T, olive oil]
 - [1, bunch, chard, "washed and chopped (or spinach, kale, beet greens)"]
 - [3, c, vegetable broth]
 - [1, t, lemon juice]
steps:
 - Rinse beans. Add sage, garlic, and enough water to cover by 2 inches. Bring water to a boil and then reduce heat. Simmer until beans are tender, 2-4 hours. Add salt to taste when beans are almost tender.
 - Cook onion in olive oil on medium heat until golden brown, 20-30 minutes. 
 - Combine 1.5c beans, 2c broth, and onions and puree until smooth and creamy. 
 - Combine puree, beans, and greens, and enough broth so that the soup pours easily from the ladle. Simmer until the greens are tender.
 - Season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice--just enough to clarify the flavor, not so much that it becomes tart. Serve very hot, drizzled with olive oil.
