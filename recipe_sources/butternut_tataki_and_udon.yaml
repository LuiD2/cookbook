steps:
- Gently heat the vinegar, sugar, ginger and salt in a small saucepan, stirring so the sugar dissolves, then remove from the heat and set aside.
- Put a ridged griddle pan on a high heat. While the pan is heating up, toss the butternut batons in the groundnut oil. Turn down the heat under the griddle to medium-high and chargrill the squash in batches for about four minutes each, turning so that all sides get grilled. Transfer to a large bowl, pour over half the dressing while the batons are still hot and set aside to cool, gently stirring from time to time.
- Bring a large pan of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook for six to seven minutes. Drain, refresh under cold water and set aside to dry.
- Add the dry noodles to the butternut squash bowl, followed by all the remaining ingredients. Stir gently, transfer to a serving plate, spoon on the remaining dressing and serve.
