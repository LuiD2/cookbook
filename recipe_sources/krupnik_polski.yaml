steps:
- Clean and slice fresh mushrooms and soak dried wild mushrooms.  Heat butter and olive oil till butter is melted.  Add the onion, celery, carrot, garlic, leek, and barley stir until slightly softened, do not brown.  
- Raise the heat to medium high and add fresh mushrooms and season with salt and pepper.  Cook 8 minutes until they are golden brown, stirring frequently.
- Reduce heat and add thyme, bay leaf, and flour, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pan for 5-8 minutes.  
- Add the stock and the rest of the ingredients, except the cream (or yogurt) and dill.  
- Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer until slightly thickened for 30 minutes or until mushrooms and vegetables are tender.  If too thick, add more chicken stock or water.
- Remove the pot from heat and serve.  Or, keep on low heat and add heavy cream (or sour cream / yogurt) to make a creamy krupnik soup.  Taste and adjust seasoning, adding a few drops of lemon juice if desired.  Cook for another 5-7 minutes.
- Ladle into warm bowls and garnish with fresh dill or parsley.
