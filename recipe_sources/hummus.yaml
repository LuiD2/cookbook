ingredients:                                                                                                           
 - [1, cup, chickpeas, dry]
 - [2,teaspoons, baking soda]
 - [5, T, lemon juice]
 - [4, cloves, garlic]
 - [1.75, teaspoon, kosher salt]
 - [1, cup, tahini]
 - [0.5, teaspoon, cumin]
steps:  
  - In a bowl, cover chickpeas by at least 2 inches of cold water. Add {1, teaspoon, baking soda} and let soak at room temperature overnight. Drain and rinse.
  - In a medium pot, cover soaked chickpeas by at least 4 inches of water. Add the remaining teaspoon baking soda and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium high and let cook at a vigorous simmer until chickpeas are quite soft, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. (Overcooked chickpeas are the secret to creamy hummus, so don’t worry if they start to break down a little.) Drain.
  - While chickpeas are cooking, make the tahini sauce. In a blender, combine the lemon juice, garlic and {0.25, teaspoon, salt}. Let mixture sit 10 minutes. Add tahini, remaining {1.5, teaspoon, salt} and the cumin, and blend until a thick paste forms. Add about {0.5,cup, water} (very cold) while blender is running, a little at a time, until sauce is smooth. You’re looking for a perfectly smooth, creamy sauce.
  - Add the warm, drained chickpeas to blender with tahini mixture. Blend until perfectly smooth and not at all grainy, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl occasionally. This blending may take upward of about 2 minutes; just keep going until the mixture is ultracreamy and fluffy, adding a little water if you need it to make the contents of the blender move. Taste for seasonings, adding more salt, lemon juice and/or cumin as needed.
  - To serve, spread the hummus on a plate, dust with paprika, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with parsley.
