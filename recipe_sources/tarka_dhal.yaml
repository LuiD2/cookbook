ingredients: 
 - [150, g, split red lentils, masoor dhal]
 - [150, g, yellow split mung beans, mung dhal]
 - [105, ml, sunflower oil]
 - [1, t, cumin seeds]
 - [0.5, t, brown mustard seeds]
 - [0.25, t, asafetida]
 - [3, ct, tomatoes, medium (or canned)]
 - [1, t, turmeric]
 - [1.5, t, salt]
 - [3, t, coriander seeds, ground or whole]
 - [0.5, t, cumin seeds, ground or whole]
 - [0.5, t, garam masala]
 - [0.5, c, cilantro, chopped]
 - [5, ct, green chiles, fresh (serranos or fewer jalapenos)]
 - [5, clove, garlic]
steps: 
 - If using whole cumin and coriander, toast {3, t, coriander seeds} and {0.5, t, cumin seeds} and then grind into powder.
 - Mix the dhals together, then rinse at least 4 times and drain. 
 - Crush the chilis and garlic togehter with a pinch of salt using a mortar 
   and pestle or blender to make a fine masala paste. 
 - Put the dhals into a large pan and add 700ml boiling water. Bring to a boil,
   then simmer over medium heat for a couple of minutes until it starts to foam. Skim the froth
   from the surface, add {1, t, sunflower oil} and simmer three-quarters covered for 25 minutes or so,
   stirring occasionally, until the dhals are soft and cooked through. Remove the pan from the heat 
   and set aside, but do not drain. 
 - Heat the oil in a separate large pan for 30 seconds over medium heat, then add the cumin and mustard 
   seeds. When the mustard seeds start to pop, stir in the asafateda, then reduce the heat to low and add the 
   tomatoes--watch for spattering oil.
 - Stir in the masala paste, turmeric, salt, coriander, and cumin. Increase the heat to medium and leave to cook
   for a minute, then stir in the dhals, along with the water they were cooked in. Pour in {100, ml, water}, boiling,
   stir, simmer for 2 minutes, then stir in the garam masala. Adding the garam masala right at the end ensures that it
   is the first spice you taste, with the other spices following for a deeper, longer-lasting flavor. 
 - Remove from heat, sprinkle with the cilantro, then cover the pan and leave to rest for at least 10 minutes to allow the
   flavors to infuse.
