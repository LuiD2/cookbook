ingredients:
 - [1.75, c, chickpeas, dry (or part fava beans)]
 - [1, c, parsley, chopped (or mix with cilantro)]
 - [2, clove, garlic, crushed]
 - [1, ct, onion, quartered]
 - [1, T, lemon juice, fresh]
 - [1, T, cumin, ground]
 - [1, t, coriander, ground]
 - [2, t, chile powder, mild]
 - [1, t, salt]
 - [0.5, t, pepper]
 - [0.5, t, baking soda]
steps: 
 - Put the beans in a large bowl and cover with water by 3 to 4 inches. (They will triple in volume as they soak.) Soak the beans for 24 hours, checking once or twice to see if you need to add more water to keep the beans submerged.
 - Drain the beans well and transfer to a food processor with the parsley, garlic, onion, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, cayenne, salt, pepper, and baking soda. Pulse until almost smooth, scraping down the side of the bowl as necessary. Add one or 2 tablespoons water if necessary to allow the machine to do its work, but keep the mixture as dry as possible. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt, pepper, cayenne, or lemon juice as needed.
 - Pour oil to a depth of at least 2 inches in a large, deep pot. More is better; the narrower the pot, the less oil you need, but the more oil you use, the more patties you can cook at the same time. Turn the heat to medium-high and heat the oil to about 350°F; a pinch of the batter should sizzle immediately.
 - Scoop out heaping tablespoons of the batter and shape into balls or small patties. Fry in batches, without crowding, until nicely browned, turning as necessary; total cooking time will be less than 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to paper towels to drain (they can be kept warm in a low oven, if you like, until they are all cooked). Serve hot or at room temperature. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refriger- ator; reheat in a 350°F oven until hot and crisp, about 15 minutes.
notes: 
- For sesame falafel, add 1/4 cup sesame seeds and 3 tablespoons tahini.
- Nice with zaatar
- Variation. Replace 1/2 cup of the beans with walnuts, almonds, peanuts, or hazelnuts (don’t soak the nuts). Omit the garlic, cumin, and cayenne. Use parsley, or substitute 1 tablespoon or so fresh thyme leaves for the herb.
