ingredients:
 - [140, g, chickpea flour]
 - [1, t, salt]
 - [1, t, cumin (ground)]
 - [3, T, oil (olive)]
 - [250, g, apricots, or yellow peaches pitted and diced]
 - [120, g, zucchini]
 - [1, t, thyme (fresh)]
steps:
 - Make socca tart base. In a medium bowl, combine chickpea flour, salt, cumin, and {3, T, oil (olive)}. Pour in {0.75, c, water} (cold) in a slow stream, whisking constantly. The mixture will be thinner than pancake batter. Cover and let rest for 2 hours, or overnight in the fridge. 
 - Preheat the oven to 400F with a 10-inch cast iron pan.  
 - Whisk the batter again. Pour a good glug of oil into the pan, swirl it around, and add batter to the pan, swirling to coat the entire surface. Bake until set, 25-30 minutes. Then broil for 10 minutes. 
 - Cook apricots in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, uncovered, until very soft, about 10 minutes. Increase the heat, bring to a simmer, and cook for 5 minutes more until slightly thickened.
 - Mandoline the zucchini into paper-thin rounds.
 - Place the socca browned side up on a serving dish and spread with apricot compote. Scatter zucchini rounds on top, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and thyme.
