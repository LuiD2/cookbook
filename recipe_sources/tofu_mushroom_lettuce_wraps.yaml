ingredients:
 - [14, oz, tofu (extra firm)]
 - [16, oz, mushrooms (oyster)]
 - [2.5, T, oil]
 - [5, t, sesame oil (toasted)]
 - [1.5, T, tamari]
 - [1, T, arrowroot powder]
 - [1.5, T, panko]
 - [1, T, sesame seeds]
 - [3, oz, rice noodles, cooked]
 - [4, T, almond butter]
 - [1, T, sriracha sauce]
 - [1, T, vinegar (rice)]
 - [1, T, maple syrup]
 - [1, inch, ginger, minced]
 - [3, clove, garlic, crushed]
 - [1, head, lettuce (butter leaf)]
 - [10, g, cilantro]
 - [1, ct, scallion]
steps:
 - Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper (so the tofu and mushrooms don’t stick to the pan).
 - Drain the tofu and press it.
 - Prepare the tofu. Once pressed, chop the tofu into small cubes. Place tofu cubes in a medium or large bowl. Add {1, T, oil}, {2, t, sesame oil}, {1, T, tamari}, and {0.25, t, salt}. Toss to combine. Then add the arrowroot powder, panko, and sesame seeds. Gently toss to combine, using a spoon or your hands. Spread the tofu out in a single layer on the lined baking sheet.
 - Prepare the mushrooms. Clean off the oyster mushrooms them with a damp towel. Then, slice of the tough woody ends. Use your hands to separate the bunches into individual mushrooms; for large mushrooms, slice them in half. Add the mushrooms to the same bowl used for the tofu; toss with the remaining {1.5, T, oil}, and season with salt and pepper. Place the mushrooms on another lined baking sheet.
 - Bake the tofu and mushrooms. Bake the tofu for 25-30 minutes until crispy and browned, tossing halfway through. Bake the mushrooms until the bottom side is blistered and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and flip each of the mushrooms; return the sheet to the oven until the other side is golden, another 15 minutes.
 - While the tofu and mushrooms are baking, cook the rice noodles according to the package. When they are done cooking, drain the noodles.
 - You can serve the noodles whole, but for ease of eating, I like to use scissors to cut the noodles into bite-sized pieces.
 - While the tofu and mushrooms are baking, make the Spicy Almond-Sesame Sauce. Add the almond butter to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat for 25 seconds to help loosen it up. Then add the remaining ingredients and whisk well to combine. Then, stream in {2, T, water} and whisk to thin out the sauce until pourable but still thick.
 - Assemble the lettuce wraps. Separate the lettuce leaves. Spoon a small amount of the cooked rice noodles on top, followed by the baked tofu and mushrooms. Spoon the sauce on top. Repeat with remaining lettuce and fillings.
