ingredients:
  - [12, oz, cauliflower, finely minced]
  - [1.5, lb, potatoes, scrubbed and peeled if desired and quartered]
  - [0.5, cup, cilantro, chopped ]
  - [2, t, cumin seeds, toasted and lightly crushed]
  - [2, teaspoons, nigella seeds]
  - [1, teaspoon, garam masala]
  - [0.5, teaspoon, chili powder (Aleppo)]
  - [0.25, cup, black quinoa]
  - [1, cup, sesame seeds, mixed black and white]
  - [0.25, cup oil (grapeseed)]

steps:
- Cook the quinoa (2 parts water to one part quinoa).
- Steam potatoes over 1 inch of boiling water until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and mash with a fork. The skins will break up in the mash.
- Line steamer with cheesecloth and place cauliflower on cheesecloth so the small pieces donâ€™t fall through. Steam 5 to 6 minutes, until very tender. Remove from heat and stir into potatoes. Add remaining ingredients except sesame seeds and oil. Season generously with salt, combine well, taste and adjust seasonings.
- Place sesame seeds in a wide bowl. Scoop out about {0.33, c, cauliflower-potato mixture} and roll into a ball (moisten your hands to prevent sticking). Roll in the seeds, then gently flatten into a patty shape. Place on a plate or sheet pan and continue to shape all of the patties. If you have time, refrigerate for 1 hour or longer (I have made these with no problem without refrigerating first).
- When you are ready to cook, place a rack over a sheet pan and cover the rack with paper towels. Heat {2, tablespoons, oil} in a large, heavy nonstick frying pan over high heat. When pan is hot, swirl to coat with oil. Turn heat down to medium. Place 3 to 5 patties in the pan (do not crowd), and cook until well browned on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn and brown for 3 to 4 more minutes. Remove to rack. Heat remaining oil in the pan and cook remaining patties. Remove paper towels from underneath patties and keep them warm in a low oven until ready to serve. Serve topped with Sriracha, with a salad on the side.
