notes: 
 - The original version of this recipe calls for 1 cup milk or buttermilk, but I split the difference and use ½ cup of each. The texture of the batter was lovely, and I liked the slight tangy quality of the waffles, so I’d recommend that you try the same course of action.
ingredients:
 - [0.75, cup, flour (all-purpose)] 
 - [0.25, cup, cornstarch] 
 - [0.5,t, baking powder] 
 - [0.25, t, baking soda] 
 - [0.5, t, salt] 
 - [1.5, t, sugar] 
 - [0.5, c, milk, whole] 
 - [0.5, cup, buttermilk] 
 - [0.33, c, oil]
 - [1, ct, egg, lightly beaten] 
 - [0.75, t, vanilla extract] 
steps:
 - In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Whisk well. Add the milk, buttermilk, vegetable oil, egg, and vanilla extract. Whisk to blend well, so that few (if any) lumps remain. Set aside to rest for 30 minutes.
 - Preheat a waffle iron. Follow your waffle maker’s instruction manual for this, but my guess is that you’ll want to heat it on whatever setting is approximately medium-high. My waffle maker has a heat dial that runs from 1 to 7, and I turned it to 5. There’s no need to grease the waffle maker.
 - Pour an appropriate amount of batter into your hot waffle maker. This amount will vary from machine to machine, and you should plan to use your first waffle as a test specimen. Cook until golden and crisp.
