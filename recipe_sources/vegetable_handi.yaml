ingredients: 
 - [100, ml, sunflower oil]
 - [1, t, cumin seeds]
 - [1, ct, onion, blended to a fine paste]
 - [400, g, tomatoes, canned]
 - [1, ct, waxy potato, red or white cut into 1.5cm cubes]
 - [1, ct, carrot, cut into 5mm disks]
 - [1.5, t, salt]
 - [1.5, t, turmeric]
 - [3, t, coriander seeds, ground or whole]
 - [0.5, t, cumin seeds, ground or whole]
 - [0.5, c, cilantro, chopped]
 - [1, ct, red pepper, cut into 1.5cm cubes]
 - [1, ct, green pepper, cut into 1.5cm cubes]
 - [1, ct, cauliflower, cut into small florets]
 - [150, g, peas, fresh or frozen]
 - [0.5, t, garam masala]
 - [3, ct, green chiles, fresh (serranos or fewer jalapenos)]
 - [3, clove, garlic]
 - [5, cm, ginger, peeled and chopped]
steps: 
 - If using whole cumin and coriander, toast {3, t, coriander seeds} and {0.5, t, cumin seeds} and then grind into powder.
 - Crush the chiles, garlic, and ginger together with a pinch of salt using a mortar and pestle
   or a blender (if using a blender, chop ginger against the fiber first), to make a fine masala
   paste.
 - Heat the oil in a large pan for 90 seconds over a medium heat, then add the cumin seeds. When they
   start to brown, stir in the onion, watching out for spattering oil. Increase the heat to high, cover the 
   pan, and leave it to cook for a minute before stirring, then cover again and repeat 3-4 times until 
   the onion has caramelized to a lovely dark brown. Take care not to burn it. This browning of the onion 
   is important, as it gives the dish its rich color and sweet flavor. 
 - Stir in the tomatoes, potato, carrot, and {300,ml,water} (boiling). Cover and leave to simmer for 7-8 minutes
   over high heat. Add the masala paste, salt, turmeric, coriander, cumin, and cilantro and mix well. Stir in the 
   peppers, caulifolwer, and another {100, ml, water} (boiling), being careful not to break up the vegetables.
 - Reduce the heat to medium, then cover the pan and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the peas along with a final {50, ml, water} (boiling),
   then cover again and simmer for a further 5 minutes. Check to see whether the potato is cooked through--if not, 
   reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for another 5 minutes. 
 - Stir in the garam masala, remove from heat, cover, and leave to rest for 15 minutes to let the flavors develop.
