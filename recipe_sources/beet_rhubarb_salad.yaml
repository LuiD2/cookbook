ingredients:
 - [9, ct, beets, various kinds and medium size]
 - [300, g, rhubarb, cut at angle into 1-inch pieces]
 - [30, g, sugar (caster)]
 - [2, t, vinegar (sherry)]
 - [0.75, T, pomegranate molasses]
 - [2, T, maple syrup]
 - [2, T, oil (olive)]
 - [0.5, t, allspice]
 - [75, g, onion (red), thinly sliced]
 - [20, g, parsley] 
 - [100, g, gorgonzola]
steps:
 - Preheat the oven to 425F.
 - Wrap the beetroots individually in foil, place on a baking tray and roast in the oven for anywhere between 40 and 70 minutes, depending on their size, until cooked through. Set aside to cool before peeling and cutting roughly into 2cm dice.
 - Toss the rhubarb with the sugar, spread out on a small roasting tray lined with foil and bake for about 12 minutes, until the pieces have softened without becoming mushy. Set aside to cool.
 - Place the vinegar, molasses, maple syrup, oil and allspice in a bowl with {0.5, t, salt} and a good grind of black pepper. Add the onion and set aside for a few minutes to soften. Add the parsley and beetroot and stir well. Just before serving, add the Gorgonzola and the rhubarb, along with its juices. Give everything a very gentle mix and serve at once.
