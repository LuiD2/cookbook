ingredients: 
 - [1, kg, spinach, fresh (or substitute frozen)]
 - [150, ml, sunflower oil]
 - [1, t, fenugreek seeds]
 - [1, t, brown mustard seeds]
 - [0.25, t, asafetida]
 - [370, g, button mushrooms, halved]
 - [2, ct, tomatoes, medium (or canned)]
 - [1.25, t, salt]
 - [1.5, t, turmeric]
 - [3, t, coriander seeds, ground or whole]
 - [0.5, t, cumin seeds, ground or whole]
 - [1, t, garam masala]
 - [0.5, c, cinaltro, chopped]
steps: 
 - If using whole cumin and coriander, toast {3, t, coriander seeds} and {0.5, t, cumin seeds} and then grind into powder.
 - Rinse and trim spinach, and chop into 1cm-wide strips. 
 - Crush chilis, garlic, and ginger together with a pinch of salt using a mortar and pestle or 
   blender to make a fine masala paste.
 - Heat the oil in a large pan, then add the fenugreek seeds and mustard seeds. When the mustard seeds
   start to pop, stir in the asafetida and mushrooms. Cook uncovered for 2 minutes or so, gently stirring,
   then mix in the masala paste, tomatoes, salt, turmeric, coriander, cumin, garam masala, and cilantro.
 - Stir over medium heat for a couple of minutes, then add the spinach. If using fresh spinach the chopped 
   leaves will be bulky, so you may need to do this in several stages--add as much as you can, cover the pan 
   and allow it to wilt down for a couple of minutes before stirring in, then add the next batch. Increase the heat
   to high and cook uncovered for 6 minutes or so, until the water released by the spinach and mushrooms has 
   evaporated.
 - Remove from heat and leave to rest, uncovered, for at least 10 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse.
