ingredients:
 - [2, T, grapeseed oil]
 - [3, ct, leeks, white + light green parts chopped (discard green tops or use them for stock)]
 - [4, sprig, thyme, leaves minced]
 - [1, bulb, fennel, cored and chopped (reserve a few fronds for garnish)]
 - [1, ct, apple, peeled and chopped (medium)]
 - [1.5, t, turmeric, ground]
 - [0.5, cup, walnuts, toasted]
 - [4, cup, vegetable stock]
steps:
- Heat the grapeseed oil in a large soup pot over medium. Add the chopped leeks and thyme. Stir and sauté the leeks until they are a bit soft, about 4 minutes. Add the chopped fennel and apples. Stir everything up a bit. Add the turmeric and stir to coat all of the vegetables evenly. Sauté the vegetables until the fennel is starting to soften, another 4 minutes. Add the walnuts and stir them in. Season the whole thing with salt and pepper. Add the vegetable stock and stir.
- Bring the pot to a boil and simmer until all of the vegetables/apples are very soft, about 12-15 minutes. Remove the soup from the heat. Carefully blend the mixture in batches until totally smooth. Check the soup for seasoning and adjust accordingly. Bring the puréed soup to a boil and serve hot with drizzles of maple syrup, fresh black pepper, fennel fronds and more toasted walnuts.
