 - [300, ml, water]
steps:
 - Soak chickpeas overnight. 
 - Change the chickpeas' water and boil until tender. Remove from heat and set aside, still in their cooking water.
 - Heat 4 t oil in a small pan for 30 seconds over low heat, then stir in coriander seeds, cinnamon, red chilis, cloves, 
   peppercorns, bay leaves, and half the cumin seeds. Fry for about 5 minutes, until dark brown, stirring continuously so 
   they don't burn. Then set this garam masala aside to cool.
 - Heat the remaining oil in a large pan for a minute over medium heat, the add the remaining cumin seeds and fry until they
   start to brown. This only takes a minute or so, so be careful not to burn them. Stir in the onion paste (watch for spattering
   oil) and fry until dark brown, stirring regularly to avoid burning. 
 - Crush the ginger using a mortar and pestle or a blender (chop against the fiber first if blending) to make a fine pulp. Stir the tomatoes
   into the onions, followed by the ginger, salt, red chili powder, turmeric, and sugar. then increase the heat to high. Stir in the 
   chickpeas with their cooking water, along with the additional water. Leave the pan to simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
 - While the chickpeas are cooking, finely grind the cooled spice. Add to the chickpea mixture and remove from heat. 
 - Sprinkle with the chopped cilantro, then cover and leave to rest for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse.
