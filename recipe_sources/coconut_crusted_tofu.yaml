notes:
 - Consider using okara instead of panko
ingredients:
 - [14, oz, tofu (extra firm)]
 - [0.25, c, soy sauce]
 - [0.25, c, sugar (coconut)]
 - [2, T, lime juice]
 - [0.5, t, ginger, grated]
 - [2, T, flour (whole wheat)]
 - [2, T, corn starch]
 - [0.25, t, baking powder]
 - [0.5, c, panko]
 - [0.75, c, coconut (shredded)]
 - [0.25, c, oil]
 - [0.5, c, coconut cream]
 - [2, T, pineapple juice]
 - [1, t, chili garlic sauce]
steps:
 - Press the tofu with several layers of paper towel to remove as much water as possible. Cut the tofu into ½-inch slabs and press with paper towels again.
 - To prepare the marinade, first combine the soy sauce and coconut sugar in a small mixing bowl. Microwave in 15-second intervals, stirring in between, until the coconut sugar dissolves. This should take less than a minute. Add {2, t,  lime juice} and fresh ginger. Whisk to combine.
 - Transfer the tofu to a shallow baking dish and pour in the marinade. Move the pieces around so each is completely coated. Cover and place in the fridge for at least two hours, flipping the pieces over and recovering with the marinade half way through. Put your can of coconut milk in the refrigerator at this time, too.
 - While the tofu is marinating, prepare the batter. Combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder and water in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk to combine. Set in the fridge until you’re ready to cook the tofu.
 - Once the tofu is done marinating, remove it from the refrigerator along with the can of coconut milk. Pour the panko breadcrumbs and shredded coconut onto a large plate and use your hands to mix it up. Remove the batter from the fridge and stir. The texture should be similar to pancake batter. If it’s too thick, add another teaspoon of cold water. Line another large plate with a layer of paper towels and set it next to the stove.
 - Heat ¼ cup of vegetable or canola oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, the oil should glide easily across the pan. Take the first piece of tofu and dip it in the batter. Shake gently to remove any excess, and then dredge it through the panko/coconut mixture so it’s coated on all sides. Carefully place it in the skillet – it should sizzle right away. If it doesn’t, your oil isn’t hot enough yet.
 - Coat each piece of tofu in batter, followed by the panko/coconut mixture. Working in batches, cook tofu for about 3 minutes on each side, until crispy and golden brown. Transfer cooked tofu pieces to the paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil. You may need to switch out the oil halfway through if there’s a lot of debris floating around in it. Those little coconut flakes burn quickly!
 - While the tofu cools, prepare the sauce. Flip the can of coconut milk upside down and open it from the bottom. Pour off the liquid and scoop ½ cup of the solid coconut cream into a blender. Add the pineapple juice, lime juice, and chili garlic sauce. Blend until smooth. Alternatively, you can whisk the sauce by hand in a small mixing bowl. Adjust flavors to taste.
 - Serve tofu warm with a drizzle of sweet chili sauce and a squeeze of lime, if desired.
